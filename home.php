              <li class="mb-2">Confirm that you are authorized to stay within the hostel premises and only occupy the room officially assigned to you. Do not use or sleep in rooms that are assigned to other residents without prior permission. This ensures orderly living arrangements and respects the privacy of others.</li>
              <li class="mb-2">Keep only essential items in your room to minimize the risk of theft. The hostel authorities are not liable for any loss or theft of personal belongings, so take necessary precautions to secure your valuables and avoid storing them in the hostel.</li>
              <li class="mb-2">Dress appropriately and maintain a respectful appearance while in the hostel. A decent dress code contributes to a positive living environment and ensures that all residents feel comfortable and respected.</li>
              <li class="mb-2">Immediately report any cases of contagious diseases to the Warden, Deputy Warden, Resident Tutors, or hostel information service. Prompt reporting helps in implementing preventive measures to protect the health of all residents.</li>
              <li class="mb-3">Be present in the hostel after 5:30 p.m. and remain on the premises during class hours and other institutional obligations. If an emergency arises, communicate it clearly and seek approval from the Warden to avoid any issues related to attendance.</li>

      <ul class="custom-list">
        <li class="mb-2">Do not permit unauthorized guests or outsiders to enter the hostel or its rooms. Allowing unauthorized individuals inside could lead to disciplinary action or expulsion, as it compromises the security and safety of the hostel.</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Do not occupy or transfer to rooms that are not officially assigned to you. Unauthorized use or swapping of rooms is prohibited, ensuring that room assignments are respected and orderly.</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Avoid storing costly or highly valuable items in the hostel. The hostel is not responsible for the loss or theft of such items, so it is wise to secure valuables elsewhere to prevent potential theft.</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Do not allow day scholars inside the hostel. Facilitating their stay or access to your room will result in disciplinary measures, as day scholars are not permitted within the hostel premises.</li>
        <li class="mb-3">Do not neglect the requirement to be present in the hostel after 5:30 p.m. and during other scheduled times. Failure to comply with attendance rules without proper notification or approval from the Warden could lead to disciplinary action.</li>
